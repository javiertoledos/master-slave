I like to start with this phrase, because it ilustrates perfectly the spirit of what I think we should pursuit. 
We live in a world where, given some amount of power and given an idea with good popularity, you can
censor contrary opinions. 

It's common  in our societies that if you say an unpopular opinion, everyone goes against you,  as if you 
shouldn't have the right of free speech, but also, if you criticize  a popular opinion, you will also get hate 
very easily. We're not being tolerant, we're just trying to be right at all costs, having to be "politically correct" 
above common sense or above telling the truth.

The popular opinion this time is, the desire to change the name "master" because it appeals to the slavery 
and it may offend someone. The first time I read about this was in this [dev.to article](https://dev.to/damcosset/replacing-master-in-git-2jim). 
Briefly, it says:

> master/slave is an oppressive metaphor referring to the practice of slavery.

Slavery existed, and still exists. PERIOD. Changing somthing "trivial" as the main branch name (considering 
that master is the main branch) wont change the facts, that in latin america for example, 
[children don't go to school, instead they harvest the coffee][1] that eventually ends in a latte you drink in your 
favorite cafe. The [forced labour in the palm oil industry][2], where the oil is used in half of the products 
everybody consumes. [Girls forced to marry men][3] they never met before or they don't like, and so on.

And despite all above, the "master" branch is one of the lesser evils we have to face. We neglect words and behaviors
that don't change the harsh reality outside the wealthy world. I really believe there are more powerful ways to 
change  the world than just arging "Words matter", because they do, but come on, don't want slavery, you can try
stop consuming products that enslave people. 

It's time to separate intention from meanings. The person who used master/slave, maybe didn't want to promote slavery, 
just tried to evoke a concept easy to remember. My mother died when I was a kid, and I'm used to questions like
"How is yoru mother?", It would be have been stupid if I would get offended just because I don't have a mother
and that person should have been considered if I had one in first place. This is the same kind of irrationality
governing several people around the globe, like the [cultural appropiation concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT2UH74ksJ4); cringe;

Given said that, it doesn't mean I'm completely disagree with the idea, I just wanted to be clear that this whole
idea may change the way the branches are named, but nothing else. Racial discrimation will still exist. Slavery will
still exist. Poverty will still exists. All of that even after you updated your pipeline configuration to use 
production/original branch instead of master, even after you updated whitelist/blacklist to deny list/allow list.

Hope all of us find someday a more meaningful way to change this world for better.
